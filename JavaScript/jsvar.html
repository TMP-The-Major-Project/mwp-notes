// Variables declared with var can have a global or local scope. 
// Global scope is for variables declared outside functions, while local scope is for variables declared inside functions.
//If you create a variable outside of a function in a global space, you can use it anywhere in your code.
//If you create a variable inside a function, you can only use it within that function.
// variables declared using var can be re-declared

// use of the var keyword to declare global variables in JavaScript.
