// Variables declared with let can have a global, local, or block scope. 
// Block scope is for variables declared in a block i.e. enclosed within {}. For Eg : within a function or loops.
//The variables having the block scope canâ€™t be accessed outside that particular code block ({block}). The variable is only available inside the block {} where you define it.
//The let keyword is an improved version of the var keyword. It is introduced in the ES6 or EcmaScript 2015. 

//use of the let keyword to declare variables in JavaScript
console.log("use of the let keyword to declare variables in JavaScript");
let a = 10;     //global scope
function f() {
    let b = 9   //local scope 
    console.log(b);
    console.log(a);
}
f();
console.log(a);
console.log(b); // throws "Uncaught ReferenceError: b is not defined" error   

// variables declared with let can be reassigned to other values, but they cannot be redeclared (within the same scope).

//re-declaring in the same scope.
let z = 10
console.log(z);
z = 20
console.log(z);
let z = 15        // throws "SyntaxError: Identifier 'z' has already been declared"
console.log(z); 

//re-declaring in different scope.
let m = 5
function f() {
    let m = 25;
    console.log(m);
}
f();
console.log(m)

//Hoisting : let variables are hoisted without a default initialization. 
// So when you try to access such variables, you get "cannot access variable before initialization" error. 

console.log("Before declaring :",ab);
let ab = "Doe";
console.log("After declaring:",ab);
